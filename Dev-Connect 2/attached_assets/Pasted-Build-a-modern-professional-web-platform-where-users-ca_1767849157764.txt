Build a modern, professional web platform where users can upload their portfolios and receive reviews and threaded feedback from industry professionals.  Core concept: - Creators upload portfolios (images, PDFs, and videos) - Industry professionals review portfolios and leave comments - Other users can reply to comments (threaded replies) - The platform focuses on constructive, professional feedback  Target users: - Designers, developers, artists, and creative professionals - Recruiters, senior practitioners, and industry experts  Key features: 1. User authentication    - Sign up / log in    - User roles: Creator, Reviewer (can overlap)    - User profiles with bio, role, experience, and portfolio links  2. Portfolio upload    - Support images, PDFs, and video files    - Video uploads should be playable directly in the browser    - Each portfolio has:      - Title      - Description      - Tags / categories      - Upload date  3. Review & feedback system    - Comment system under each portfolio    - Nested replies (threaded comments)    - Ability to like or upvote helpful feedback    - Clear visual hierarchy between reviews and replies  4. UI / UX design    - Modern, minimal, and professional design    - Clean typography and generous spacing    - Neutral color palette with subtle accent colors    - Responsive design (desktop-first, but mobile-friendly)    - Portfolio-focused layout (content comes first)  5. Tech requirements    - Use a modern frontend framework (React preferred)    - Backend with REST or API routes    - Database for users, portfolios, comments, and replies    - Secure file handling for uploads    - Prepare the project so it can be deployed easily  6. Optional but recommended    - Portfolio preview thumbnails    - Sorting or filtering by category or tags    - Reviewer badges or credibility indicators    - Simple moderation tools (delete or report comments)  Deliverables: - Clean, well-structured project code - Clear separation of frontend and backend logic - Comments in code explaining major parts - Focus on scalability and clarity rather than over-engineering  The overall tone of the platform should feel professional, trustworthy, and suitable for real-world portfolio reviews by industry experts.

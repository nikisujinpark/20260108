Build a modern, professional web platform where users upload portfolios and receive expert-level reviews — but instead of recruiting real industry professionals, the “experts” are AI reviewers specialized by domain. The system should route each portfolio to one or more domain-tuned AI reviewers and return structured feedback plus threaded follow-up replies.

Core concept:
- Creators upload portfolios (images, PDFs, and videos)
- AI “expert reviewers” provide domain-specific critiques (e.g., UX/UI, graphic design, product design, motion/film, 3D, illustration, branding, frontend, game art, etc.)
- Each domain expert is implemented as a separate AI model endpoint (fine-tuned per field) or a configurable model profile
- Users can ask follow-up questions and get threaded AI replies
- The platform feels like a real professional review community, but powered by specialized AI

Key features:
1. Authentication & profiles
   - Sign up / log in
   - User profile: bio, role/discipline, experience, links
   - Optional: “review preferences” (tone: strict/supportive, depth: short/medium/deep)

2. Portfolio upload & display
   - Support images, PDFs, and video uploads
   - Videos must be playable in-browser
   - Each portfolio includes: title, description, tags/categories, tools used, intent (job/critique/class), upload date
   - Clean portfolio page with media gallery and metadata

3. AI expert reviewer system (core)
   - Provide multiple AI expert types (domain-specialized):
     - UX/UI reviewer
     - Branding/identity reviewer
     - Graphic design reviewer
     - Motion/video reviewer
     - Illustration reviewer
     - 3D/CG reviewer
     - Frontend/dev reviewer
     - Game art reviewer
   - Routing:
     - Auto-detect category from tags + description + content type
     - Or allow user to manually pick which experts to request
   - Each expert returns a structured review:
     - Summary (2–4 sentences)
     - Strengths (bullets)
     - Issues / risks (bullets)
     - Suggestions (prioritized, actionable)
     - Score rubric (e.g., clarity, craft, concept, storytelling, usability, originality) with 1–5 ratings
     - Next steps (what to improve first)
   - The UI should display each AI expert as a “review card” with a name, icon, and domain badge

4. Threaded Q&A / replies with AI
   - Under each AI review, users can reply with questions
   - The same expert AI should respond in a thread (nested replies)
   - Keep conversation context per portfolio + per expert
   - Allow “regenerate” response and “ask for more depth”

5. AI integration requirements
   - Implement AI calls via API routes (server-side)
   - Support multiple model endpoints (fine-tuned models) and a fallback general model
   - Configuration file for expert profiles:
     - expert_id, name, domain, system_prompt, model_endpoint, temperature, max_tokens
   - Safety:
     - Do not produce harmful, hateful, sexual, or disallowed content
     - Keep feedback constructive and professional
     - Never claim real-world credentials; clearly label as AI reviewer
   - Performance:
     - Queue or async job handling for heavy media analysis (especially video/PDF)
     - Store AI outputs in the database to avoid recomputation

6. Database schema (minimum)
   - Users
   - Portfolios
   - Media files (type, url, metadata)
   - ExpertReviews (portfolio_id, expert_id, structured_json, created_at)
   - ReviewThreads (expert_review_id)
   - ThreadMessages (thread_id, role: user/ai, content, created_at)

7. UI / UX design
   - Modern, minimal, professional look
   - Neutral palette, strong typography, generous spacing
   - Responsive layout
   - Portfolio-first page layout
   - Review cards clearly separated by expert domain
   - Threaded reply UI similar to modern community platforms

8. Optional but recommended
   - “Request review” button with expert selection + depth slider
   - Tag-based browsing and search
   - Public/private portfolios
   - Shareable portfolio link
   - Downloadable “AI review report” (PDF)

Tech stack (make it Replit-friendly):
- Frontend: React (Next.js preferred if possible)
- Backend: API routes or Express server
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma (or SQLite for MVP)
- File upload: secure server-side upload handling (use object storage if available; otherwise local storage for MVP)

Deliverables:
- A working full-stack app with clean project structure
- Seed data for expert profiles
- Example fine-tuned endpoint placeholders (clearly separated so real endpoints can be plugged in)
- Clear documentation in README:
  - How to run locally on Replit
  - Where to configure expert models/endpoints
  - How routing works
  - Safety and limitations

The end product should feel like a high-end, trustworthy portfolio critique service powered by multiple domain-specialized AI experts.
